        <h2> About Me !! </h2>

        <p> Love music, engineering, coding, sports, TRAVELLING and drinking (Alcopop). 
            
                <br> <br> 
            I started coding because I did not do my GCSE IT and I believe the course will give me a good background and foundation in IT. I am also very interested in technology and find it hard to keep up to date, the course also gave me the opportunity to learn to use Apple software and hardware as I have been looking for that experience too. 
            <br><br> 
            I came to code nation because Ezra was constantly emailling me about the course unlike other course providers who did not seem as keen or interested.
            <br> <br> 
            The course should be allow me develop progrqrams and code for small mechanical engineering system, this will help the time taken to complete personal projects. I am slightly ashamed that I was unable to learn exactly how to deploy a website using a domain name. 
            <br> <br> 
            I love my experiencce at code nation and will commend the course to people I meet in the future.

                    <h2> My Future !! </h2>
                    <p> Engineering qualifications to degree level, with Experiences in Matlab mainly, for data analysis (databases) also some background in visual basic)!! 
                        <br><br> 
                        I love technology and keeping up to date with what is going on as the tech industry is very fast passed with big companies investing into new developments every year. The different skills I have do not generally translarte to this course whih is good as I enjoy learning new things. 
                        <br> <p>
                            Unfortunately not looking into a career in coding, the developer life is not for me however appealling. 
                                <br> 
                                I would like to become an engineer and make things that require computer system control and or analysis. This course has given me a good foundation into learning how to develop my apps which will hopefully aid in my future projects.
