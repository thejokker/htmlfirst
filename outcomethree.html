                <p>
                        The different tasks could have been sped up if allowed myself more help from colleagues and tutor rather than using the Internet to learn different tasks. 
                        <br>There was a lot of trial and error, some searches were impossible to get right. 
                        <br>Screenshots have been taken and placed on Github.

                <!-- <br> -->
                The best option I think would be to do it as a team effort. However this could have slowed it down with numerous stand-ups, which are unnecessary when working alone. 
        <br>
        The overall performance would have been greatly improved had I not missed the first two introduction days of the HTML section of the course

        <h2>3.3. Identifying Faults</h2>
        <p>
                I had little to no problems, mainly layout and presentation however this was overcome when I got help from my tutor Liam. 
                <br>There were no other real problems as the information provided on slides were sufficient to get the ball rolling in right direction.

                                <p>
                                        The trial and error method was the method most used as this would give good understanding of every procedure and process undertaken during the fault fix.

                                        The obvious test would be to use the website live and check all the buttons work and all data is displayed properly, this was done to succession.
