            Email for example makes sending information from one part of the world to the other seamless. A connection to the internet and the click of a button is all that is required to send and recieve information from anywhere in the world.
        </p> 
            <h3> Data Management</h3>
            <p>

    </p> 
    </div>

    <h3> System Efficiency</h3>
    <p>
        
            The speed is incredible at which tasks can be completed is greatly increased from weeks/months to minutes/days.

                <h3>Support</h3>
                    <p>Executives within the business must provide support to the deelopers as assumptions/"lack of guidance" can lead to great time loss. 
                        <br>
                        The project can not be allowed to reach a slump or be neglected, project motivation must be constant and positive towards overall goals.
                        <br>
                        Conflicts between tasks and or developers must be addressed and solved in a timely and respectfull manner.

                    <h3>Scope</h3>
                    <p> 
                        The project must be well defined allowing for a good time specification and workload. 
                        <br> 
                        The course of the project will bring challenges and constant adaptation, this must be limited to not allow the project goal to change and become unrelative.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Costing</h3>
                    <p> 
                        Must be kept in controll and considered during every development or change dureing the duration of the project. This aspect of the project is vital to the level of success of the project.

                        <br>
                        Positive and negative feedback must be taking into consideration when during development and thereafter as this is where the level of success is also determind. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>Equipment</h3>
                    <p> 
                        Low quality or faulty equipment must be considered for the estimated finish date as this can cause major hick ups.

                                <br> 
                    <br>
                    <p> In brief the software and hardware must be capable of completing the highest demands that the project will require.</p>
      <br> 
                <h3>Hardware</h3>
                <p>            
                    <br>
                    This would need to be selected based on the requirments of the software.
                    <br> 
                    The hardware would have to be extremely high spec if the project budget will allow however considering a reduced the price of purchased hardware will result in tasks taking longer to complete. 
                    <br> 
                    Employing personell with experience with the correct hardware will reduce the time to complete however increase the budget per time.  
                </p>
                <br> 

                <h3>Software</h3>
                <br>
                <p> 
                    It is important to keep up to date with the latest software however again the budget and hardware are major considerations. 
                    <br> 
                    The hardware if not adiquate will not allow the software to perform at optimal speed. The solution being finding a software that can perform optimally for the hardware provided. 
                    <br> 
                    licensing for software can affect the budget as updates and project time can affect the productivity of the team.

            <br> 
            <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> 
            The software Visual studio will be used as it not only permits the use to only mac and members of the team using their own hardware will be able to use the software seamlessly.  
            <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> 
            Software such as Git, Github and trello are great tools allowing for an organised and seqamless experience. 
            <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> <br>  <br>  <br>
