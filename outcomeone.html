                <li>Equipment</li>
                <p> 
                    This would need to be selected based on the requirments of the software.
                    <br> 
                    The hardware would have to be extremely high spec if the project budget will allow however considering a reduced the price of purchased hardware will result in tasks taking longer to complete. 
                    <br> 
                    Employing personell with experience with the correct hardware will reduce the time to complete however increase the budget per time.

        <p>
            <ul> 
            The hardware must be industry standard as such Apple hardware is capable of handling tasks for vigorous useage and high performance/quality. 
            <br> 
            The software Visual studio will be used as it not only limits the use to only mac and members of the team using their own hardware will be able to use the software seamlessly. 
            Software such as Git, Github and trello are great tools allowing for an organised and seqamless experience. The programs have been very usefull so far as they can be accessed from anywhere in the world, and provide some level of security for free.
