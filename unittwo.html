<h3>1.1. Describe Layout Page by Page </h3>
<p> <br> 
    Home Page .... 
    <br>    <br>    <br>
    The website was completed with a general background and numerous different boxing options that were very usefull.
<br>
The boxes were repeatedly used for a similarity and overall colour scheme co-ordination. The choice for button at the top and bottom of every page was made to minimise bugs.
<br>
If there are complaints about the content on a website it is important to react imminently, by removing the content or making other lawfull arangements to allow for avoidance of legal action. This is also the same for sensitive or offensive material, every instance of complaint should be well looked over and investigated, this will allow for a smooth running website with good reviews. 
<br> 
Following these steps will aid if the claim were to be moved forward into court. 
<br> 
<br> 

Outcomo Uno ....
<br> 
<br> 
I opted to use different language for the headings to add a little (spice) extra to appeal to a more humourous nature of the person viewing the website. 
<br> 
This page mainly talks about my personal background knowledge in IT, I do not cover as much as I would have liked however the consideration of missing the introduction I think I have done a good job in trying to catch up with the rest of the class.
<br>
<br>
The page also describes the different tools I used to develop this website and the choices availbale to anybone willing to enter the developer world.
<br>
Finally an analysis of GDPR (General Data Protection Registration) and the different benefits and disadvantages to abiding by their rules. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
Outcomo Dos  ....
<br> 
<br> 
This section has a more of an in depth look into the IT tools used, GIT&Github, Visual Studio and Trello when developing the website. Then looks at how the tools were selected, the strengths and weaknesses of the project and finally the changes that I wish I could have done had the project been allowed more time to perfect. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
Outcomo Tres  .... and Unito Dos 
<br>
<br> 
This section is a review of the overall website of which the drawbacks of tools are also mentioned in general. 
<br> 
Different methods are analysed with regard to the performance during the development of the website faults and testing is also covered. The screenshots of the front page are displayed working as expected in different browsers.

    <h3>1.5. Describe Website Constraints </h3>
    <p> 
   A rule of thumb is to assume all content is protected either by copyright or trademark.

        <br>
   Do not assume it is legal to copy or use data just because it is labelled as "loyalty-free" or "copyright-free" for example. 

        <br>
   It is important to read the terms and conditions or any documents available that may contain information on restrictions before using work (informtion/data) that is not your own. 
   <br>
   It important to keep evidence of copyright authorisation as this  will indefinitely make any claims made void immediately.

        <h3>1.6. Access Issues Considered</h3> 
        <p> 
            <br> 
            Accessibility standards also have an important role in accessible design. For example, understanding the basic Accessibility Principles and using them for developing and evaluating early prototypes helps the development team provide basic accessibility in the earliest stages. Addressing accessibility at later stages becomes increasingly difficult.
<br>
            Also, usability processes and user involvement alone cannot address all accessibility issues. Even large projects cannot cover the diversity of disabilities, adaptive strategies, and assistive technologies. Accessibility guidelines, standards, and techniques ensure that the wide range of issues are adequately covered.
    <br><br>
            Accessibility practitioners and researchers can incorporate usability techniques to improve ‘usable accessibility’. User experience designers and researchers can incorporate accessibility to make their designs work better for more people in more situations. Addressing accessibility, usability, and inclusion together can more effectively lead to a more accessible, usable, and inclusive web for everyone. Resources to help are linked throughout this page.
