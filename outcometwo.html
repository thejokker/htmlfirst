<h2> 2.1. The IT tools used are trello Github, Git and Visual studio for this task </h2>

               
               
           
               <h3>Microsoft Visual Studio</h3>
                
               <p>Microsoft Visual Studio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), initially used for developing windows OS and websites, services and applications. Today it is used for numerous platform developments, even the cloud, in addition the program can run on all pc Osâ€™s (Linux, MacOs and Windows. 
                <br>

                Visual studio supports a whole bunch of code editing/autofill techniques and allows for graphical user interface interaction for development.
                <br>
                
                The benefits of using Visual studio for development are:

                I found using the Visual studio quite simple as there was an instructor and colleagues available to help when I got stuck. The program is straight forward once the first steps are learnt and there is also a lot of help online for anything that frustrates the user.

                <h3>Trello</h3> 
        </p>
        <p> 
                <!-- <br> -->
                This website allows for web-based project management, it helps with the
                planning of projects on one platform.  <br>
                It is easy to use as everything on
                there can be edited or drag and dropped like boards, cards and lists. 
                <br>
           Trello is used for: 
                <!-- <br>
                <br> -->
                Share files (incl. photos & videos) with your team members
                <br>
                Comment on a card to update workers
                <br>
                Keep track of to-do lists
                <br>
                Set coloured labels according to priority
                <br>
                Perform batch handling of cards in a list
                <br>
                Insert new cards; this is absolutely limitless
                <br>
                
                <br>
                This is a tool that I really find amazing, it really helped me keep track of 
                my work, helping keep to my deadlines. 
                
                
                <br> 
                In Unito Dos I am really happy with the tools I used however I believe I
                could have really used them for much more than what I actually did. <br> 
                The tools are very new to me and as such I am still exploring their
                capabilities.
                <br>  </p>
                <br> 
                <h3>Git & Github</h3>
        <p>

                        GitHub is pretty much the go-to tool for crafting blogs and other websites, but not everyone gets on board with it automatically.
                        <br>  
                        It pays to know why GitHub has high utility value before actually using it, as well as the small drawbacks that prospective users need to be aware of.

                                        <p>
                                                        I believe the IT tools used were very appropriate as the tasks were all completed in good time.

                                                        The overall Unito Dos I wished I had more time to really explore the different softwares available. 
                                                        <br>
                                                        For example CodePen that allows for developing coding skills in an active environment.

                                                                <p>

The satisfaction of getting an image into the correct location or getting the borders just the right size have made me feel engrossed with pleasure.
                                                                                <br><br>

                                                                                <br>
                                                                                <br>
                                                                                The website shows different modes of which information can be displayed on a web page and how different types of data can also be displayed. Ultimately the website is functioning to the average standard. The moving background was a great achievement as I believe this is what really gave me an insight into how the code is written I had to do a lot of research to understand exactly how to generate the final product. My Unito Doser are mostly really happy with the end result which shows success. A well updated trello board which allows for good in time analysis of work done and to do. 
                                                                                <br><br>Weaknesses<br><br> 
                                                                                The background moves which can be seen as a distraction. The colour scheme is also a weakness as a few people of older age have admitted to difficulty when trying to read the text. There are very few pages and a lack of uniqueness to the webpages in comparison to others on the course. In addition I missed two days of this module during the start which has been a major drawback however the end result being a big rush to complete the project.
